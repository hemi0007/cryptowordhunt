## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to deploy ChainWords to GitHub Pages:

### 1. Create a new GitHub repository

- Sign in to GitHub
- Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
- Name your repository (e.g., "chainwords")
- Make it public or private as desired
- Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push your code to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal after creating the repository:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/chainwords.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set up GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository:

1. Go to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add these secrets:
   - Name: `SUPABASE_URL` 
   - Value: Your Supabase URL
4. Add another secret:
   - Name: `SUPABASE_KEY`
   - Value: Your Supabase service role key

### 4. Set up GitHub Pages

1. Go to "Settings" > "Pages"
2. In the "Source" section, select "GitHub Actions"
3. GitHub will use the workflow file we've created at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### 5. Run the Deployment

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Select the "Deploy ChainWords" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" > "Run workflow"
4. Wait for the workflow to complete

Once deployed, your game will be available at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/chainwords/`

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you'll need the following environment variables:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase API key

## Supabase Setup

Make sure your Supabase project has the necessary `high_scores` table with the correct schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.high_scores (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  player_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  words_found INTEGER NOT NULL,
  total_words INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add an index for faster queries on score
CREATE INDEX high_scores_score_idx ON public.high_scores(score DESC);

-- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE public.high_scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies to allow all operations (for a public leaderboard)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read access" 
ON public.high_scores FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert access" 
ON public.high_scores FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```
